   regenerate a core.

dpram_sync_1kx14_blk_mem_gen_v2_8_xst_1.ngc_xst.xrpt:
   Please see the core data sheet.

dpram_sync_1kx14_flist.txt:
   Text file listing all of the output files produced when a customized
   core was generated in the CORE Generator.

dpram_sync_1kx14_readme.txt:
   Text file indicating the files generated and how they are used.

dpram_sync_1kx14_xmdf.tcl:
   ISE Project Navigator interface file. ISE uses this file to determine
   how the files output by CORE Generator for the core can be integrated
   into your ISE project.
